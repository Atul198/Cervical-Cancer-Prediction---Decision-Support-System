# Cervical Cancer Classification (High Recall ML Model)

This repository contains an end-to-end **machine learning project for cervical cancer classification** using a structured CSV dataset.  
The primary objective is to build a model with **very high recall (~99.4%)**, ensuring minimal false negatives, which is crucial for medical screening problems.
